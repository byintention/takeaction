# Take action
Things we can do about things


## Shopping
- https://www.which.co.uk/ magazine
- https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/ - have well researched guides for a huge amount of product types, balancing ethics, cost and availability
- Cooperatives - An alternative to shareholder capitalism and often have better prices and service
- Local Coop food (but not the shitty brands they sell), Suma
- Your local shops that sell local produce (not corner shops selling Coke, Cadburys and Hovis)
- Farm shops
- Zero waste and/or circular companies - Rapanui, Miniml etc
- Local cafes and coffee roasters; not Greggs, Starbucks or Costa
- Brands at least trying - Chocolonely, Rapanui, Howies, BAM, Miniml, Bio-D
- Reduce supermarket usage - they exploit us AND their suppliers and are primarily investor focused 
- Preloved clothes - Vinted et al, eBay

### Boycotts
- Coke - biggest plastic polluter (reference)
- Amazon - https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/ethicalcampaigns/boycott-amazon
- Shein, Primark - 
- Starbucks etc  

## Money
- Coop bank, not Barclays, HSBC etc.
- How good are Revolut, Monzo, Starling?
- Make My Money Matter - https://makemymoneymatter.co.uk/banks/
- Green pension or at least green plan with current provider (probably at least some greenwash with that though)
- No crypto or AI - both an environmental disaster due to power usage, and borderline scam in a lot of cases
- Reduce debt



## Tech
- Framework laptops
- Murena De-Googled Fairphone 
- https://b4rn.org.uk/ rural broadband cooperative
- Use a VPN - free Proton works well, Mullvad is cheap and great
- Switch from Chrome and Chrome based browsers like Edge, Ecosia, Brave etc - Vivaldi or Firefox work great
- Adblocker for your browser
- Avoid main telecoms providers - use GiffGaff, EcoTalk and/or Phone Coop if you can
- No need for latest phones and computers, make them last, use reconditioned or repaired items
- Use Linux if you can - most folks don't know how to use Windows anyway, so Linux probably won't be any harder.  Ubuntu works fine on most recentish laptops/PCs and can keep older machines in use rather than landfill


## Fact checking
- https://fullfact.org/
- https://www.bestforbritain.org/scandalous_spending_tracker
- https://ground.news/
- https://allsides.com - bit right wing?


## Activism
- Join Green Party and organise with other like minded folks
- Not XR or Just Stop Oil - they are actively annoying the people they should be speaking on behalf of and their reputations are trashed. 
- Animal rights groups
- Adbusters, Badvertising and other anti advert groups
- SUV Alliance (Tyre Extinguishers if you're brave)
- Cycling pressure groups and Critical Mass
- Local MPs?
  
- Sharing things that help on socials, not just sharing more problems
- Speaking up to racism and other bigotry when friends or neighbours do it, doesn't have to cause a conflict if done right. Eg 'Say maaaate to a mate' https://www.london.gov.uk/maaate
- Laugh at racists when they try and recruit us
