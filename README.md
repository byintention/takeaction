# Take action
Things we can do about things instead of doomscrolling and posting links to bad news. Mainly UK focused. Where we earn, spend and invest our money matters, plus what we do ourselves and what organisations we support.

Remember the powers that be will try and dissuade us from reducing our working hours and how much we spend with their corporate friends. There are various defeatist arguments employed by the media and parroted by idiots to try and make us give up; It's too hard/expensive, what about China, blah blah.

There are also benefits beyond external change to all this. It feels good to get our agency back and doing something instead of just giving up and staring at corporate social media while wearing clothes made by slaves & sipping a sugar water drink.

TO-DO; Rankings of effort/impact/likely cost impact

## Shopping
- https://www.which.co.uk/ magazine
- https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/ - have well researched guides for a huge amount of product types, balancing ethics, cost and availability
- Cooperatives - An alternative to shareholder capitalism and often have better prices and service
- Local Coop food (but not the shitty brands they sell), Suma
- Your local shops that sell local produce (not corner shops selling Coke, Cadburys and Hovis)
- Farm shops
- Zero waste and/or circular companies - Rapanui, Miniml etc
- Local cafes & coffee roasters; not Greggs, Starbucks or Costa
- Brands who are at least trying - Chocolonely, Rapanui, Howies, BAM, Miniml, Bio-D
- Reduce supermarket usage - they exploit us, workers AND their suppliers and are primarily focused on investor profits  
- Preloved clothes - Vinted et al, eBay
- Sign up and use your local library
- Use and volunteer at repair cafes
- Libraries of things
- 3D printing repair parts 

### Boycotts
- Coke - biggest plastic polluter https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/2024/02/07/bffp-movement-unveils-2023-global-brand-audit-results/
- Amazon - https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/ethicalcampaigns/boycott-amazon
- Low quality, often copyright infringing tat; Amazon trash 'brands', Shein, Primark, Temu, Wish etc 
- Starbucks
- Nestle
- McDonalds

## Money
- Refuse to work for bad companies
- Reduce support for tax dodging companies - Amazon, BT, Starbucks & all the usual suspects https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/ethicalcampaigns/tax-justice/tax-avoidance-rankings
- Coop bank, Triodos, Ecology. Not Barclays, HSBC etc. who often fund fossil fuels and weapons
- How good are Revolut, Monzo, Starling?
- Make My Money Matter - https://makemymoneymatter.co.uk/banks/
- Green pension or at least green plan with current provider (probably at least some greenwash with that though)
- Avoid crypto or AI - both an environmental disaster due to power usage, and borderline scam in a lot of cases
- Reduce (non mortgage) debt
- 'Time banking'

## Tech
- Boycott Meta (Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp), X/Twitter, Google, Amazon streaming/web services, Microsoft
- Framework laptops - user repairable and upgradeable
- Murena De-Googled Fairphone - fair supply chain, user repairable, reduces privacy invasion from Android
- https://b4rn.org.uk/ rural broadband cooperative
- Use a VPN - free Proton works well, Mullvad is cheap and good
- Switch from Chrome and Chrome based browsers like Edge, Ecosia, Brave etc - Vivaldi or Firefox work great
- Adblocker for your browser
- Avoid main telecoms providers - use GiffGaff, EcoTalk and/or Phone Coop if you can
- No need for latest phones and computers - make them last, use reconditioned or repaired items
- Use Linux if you can - most folks don't know how to use Windows anyway, so Linux probably won't be any harder.  Ubuntu works fine on most recentish laptops/PCs and can keep older machines in use rather than landfill
- Don't use AI or support companies that do - based on theft, huge power and water usage etc.
- Community energy - solar, wind turbines

## Activism

### Individuals
- Sharing things that help on socials, not just sharing more problems

- Laugh at racists when they try and recruit us
- Complain to OFCOM about GBNews and other grifters when they spout lies 
- Be aware of the Alt Right pipeline and how to counter it https://archive.org/details/the-alt-right-playbook-how-to-radicalize-a-normiee
